# gpt4all_experiments
Small tests, also for different hardware

## my setup

- Python 3.11
- PyCharm

## Start 

### main dialog

Edit or start src/main.py directly. This is to test the models itself. Some on MacOS, some on Windows.

### optimizer of main (old one)

Second is main-optimizer.py => it tries to optimize the simple starting source I created - now in main-old.py ...

## Results yet:

just see in main.py -> windows/mac case-differentiation.

model_setup.yaml is filled when a model can be started under windows or mac just adding the os... after first start 
the parameters can be changed there easily

Some models run, but need more time I want to wait... (> 10 min) on my i5 mac...
